## About Boost
Boost is a Node.js framework that makes it a lot more convenient to build your next app than using a common Node.js web framework.

Boot builds on top of the hapi.js web framework and adds dozens utilities, like configuration and database management, mailing, logging, encryptiong, hashing, pagination and more. It also integrates a powerful ORM for intuitive database interactions.


## Learning
Boost has an extensive [documentation](https://boost.futurestud.io/docs) that gives you all the information to get started with the framework.
